      <h2>Welcome.</h2>
        <p>This is the official homepage and portfolio for Osaym Omar.</p>
      
      <h2>Purpose.</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this page is to serve as a quick demonstration of my HTML/CSS coding and design skills. From this page, one can also follow the external links to view other projects which I have taken part in.</p>

      <h2>Knowledge.</h2>
        <p>
          I am familiar with the HTML5. CSS3, and Python programming languages.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also have some understanding of CLI-based environments, such as the MacOS and Linux-based terminals.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am also a Hip-Hop/Rap music producer. Some work can be found <u><a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/978ozz">here.</a></u> Contact me if you are interested in working with me, or would like to hear more music.
        </p>
      
      <h2>Projects.</h2>
        <p>As time has progressed I have worked on many different projects. Here is a quick list of them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><u><a href="https://edgelordbot.imosaym.repl.co/">EdgeLordBot:</a></u> this is a project created by me during May of 2021. I decided to mess around with the now deprecated Discord.py Python module and create an (un)funny Discord bot which can be used to anger the people of Discord. I eventually succeeded, and EdgeLordBot was born. This Discord bot is hosted on <a href="https://www.replit.com/">Replit.</a></p></li>
          <li><p><u><a href="https://5thgradeusernamegenerator.imosaym.repl.co/">5thGradeUsernameGenerator:</a></u> this is a project created by me during May of 2021. After the successful creation of EdgeLordBot, I decided to continue messing around with Discord.py and create a second Discord bot, 5thGradeUsernameGenerator. This Python-based application generates random usernames that would most likely be generated in the mind of the average 5th grader.</p></li>
          <li><p><u><a href="https://randomgenbot.imosaym.repl.co/">RandomGenBot:</a></u> this is a project created by me during May of 2021. Following the creation of my second Discord bot, I decided to create one final one: RandomGenBot! This Python application has the ability to generate FAKE phone numbers, among other things.</p></li>
          <li><p><u><a href="https://stats.uptimerobot.com/XVMgnsnRxX">Status Page:</a></u> this is a small page that provides access to the status of all online services I manage. If something isn't working right, you can check to see if it's down.</p></li>
          <li><p><u><a href="Osaym.com">Osaym.com:</a></u> this website is a project that began during October 2021. I decided to code my own website because I can and had not, therefore I did. This website is written in HTML5 and CSS3, and hosted via Google Firebase. Any new HTML concepts I learn of or advancements I think of are added whenever.</p>
          <li><p><u><a href="https://replit.com/@ImOsaym/OsaymPassGen?v=1">OsaymPassgen:</a></u> this is a project created by me during the summer of 2021. It is a customizable, CLI-based Python script allowing the user to create a strong password for use with accounts on any website. The goal was to create a generator similar to that of the one included in LastPass, however entirely written in Python.</li>
