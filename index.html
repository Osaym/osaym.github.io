      <h2>Projects.</h2>
        <p>As time has progressed I have worked on many different projects. Here is a quick list of them, and a little bit of information on each one.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><u><a href="https://edgelordbot.imosaym.repl.co/">EdgeLordBot:</a></u> this is a project created by me during May of 2021. I decided to tinker with the (now deprecated) Discord.py Python module and create a(n) (un)funny Discord bot which can be used to anger the people of Discord. I eventually succeeded, and EdgeLordBot was born. This Discord bot is hosted on <a href="https://www.replit.com/">Replit.</a></p></li>
          <li><p><u><a href="https://stats.uptimerobot.com/XVMgnsnRxX">Status Page:</a></u> this is a small page that provides access to the status of all online services I manage. If something isn't working right, you can check to see if it's down.</p></li>
          <li><p><u><a href="/index.html">Osaym.com:</a></u> this website is a project that began during October 2021. I decided to code my own website because I can and had not, therefore I did. This website is written in HTML5 and CSS3, and hosted via Google Firebase. Any new HTML concepts I learn of or advancements I think of are added whenever.</p>
          <li><p><u><a href="https://replit.com/@Osaym/OsaymPassGen">OsaymPassgen:</a></u> this is a project created by me during the summer of 2021. It is a customizable, CLI-based Python script allowing the user to create a strong password for use with accounts on any website. The goal was to create a generator similar to that of the one included in LastPass, however entirely written in Python.</li>
          <li><p><u><a href="https://replit.com/@Osaym/AdvancedRockPaperScissors">AdvancedRockPaperScissors:</a></u> this is a project created by me during September 2022. Written in Python, this is a script that plays a traditional game of "rock paper scissors" with the user. Replit Database functionalities are integrated in the code to track wins, losses and ties globally on each run. The terminal is also styled colorfully to make the program enjoyable to run.</p></li>
          <li><p><u><a href="/clock.html">OsaymClock:</a></u> this page is a new project that began during December 2022 in which I am attempting to write a clock from scratch. If this sounds interesting to you, you can click the link to view it.</p></li>
